<summary> <b>Q. What types of licenses are available?</b></summary>

Currently, there are two licenses: `Engage` and `Growth`. The `Engage` license is activated when you sign up for a box by default. The `Engage` license is free and fully functional, but ads are displayed when members enter records. `Growth`, on the other hand, is paid and allows you to use all features without ADs.
