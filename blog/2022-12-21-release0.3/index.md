## Release v0.3

Daily WOD has released a new version `v0.3`ðŸ¥³ In this article, we will introduce the newly included features. 

### Calendar

Records make up for poor memory. It is usually challenging to remember how often they have workout this week or this month.

**Daily WOD shows how many times the user has workout at a glance through the calendar.** When a user adds a new WOD, it is marked with a dot on the calendar for that date. And if you select a marked date, you can see the WODs for that day.

### Similarity

Do you plan for a WOD at what intensity (or weight), and what strategy will you choose before starting? People generally infer their ability level (or limit) through memory and experience. However, memory is not enough.

**Daily WOD helps you determine the intensity or strategy of a workout through previous records.** When you register (or update) a new WOD, the Daily WOD will find the previous WOD, which is most similar. And the user can check his level and limit through the record.
